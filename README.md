# Javascript Canvas Parallax Starfield Demo

This is a demo of 2D drawing on the JavaScript canvas object in the browser. It gives examples of:

- Parallax scrolling and twinkling stars
- Using a png file as a bitmap containing sprite-based fonts

You can use the slider at the bottom of the page to adjust star density.

## What next ?

Not sure, but this was fun.
